# 3_bars

It is a script, that shows the biggest bar, the smallest bar and the nearest bar in Moscow.


## The data.

I used a data dump from data.mos.ru
Here is the [link] (http://data.mos.ru/opendata/7710881420-bary)
Just download it and run the script


## The file location
If you placed the JSON file right into the script directory, just type in the filename.
However, if you want to store data separately from script you will need to type in full path to the JSON file.


## The nearest bar

The distance between you and a bar is calculated by the [Havershine formula] (http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html)
So you will need to type in your latitude and longitude to locate the nearest place.
